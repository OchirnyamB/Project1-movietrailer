Project1-movietrailer. 8/18/2015

The main thing to notice is that I changed movie trailers to karaoke songs, which I have modified to this later, I will continue to keep working on the project, at http://www.ochiguru.com

main.py is the main file that runs the code, which sends variables to the freshtomatoes file.

I have modified the screen width and height of the iframe, the trailer video using javascript, although I was not sure it would be centered in different screen sizes.
